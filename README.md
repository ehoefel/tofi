# Tofi

An extremely fast and simple [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) /
[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) replacement for
[wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots)-based
[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositors such as
[Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/).

This repo is a fork of [phlij56/tofi](https://github.com/phlij56/tofi) with the
intention of adding support for icons in drun (specifically nerd font icons).

This readme will focus on this mod. For more information on the original project please refer to [phlij56/tofi](https://github.com/phlij56/tofi).

## Objectives

- [x] Change default font to a Mono font (JetBrains Mono) 
- [x] Add basic support for icons
- [x] Change colors config syntax to HEX
- [x] Add custom color for icons
- [ ] Add Comment from `.desktop` to line descriptors, right-padded

## State

I placed most of the features that I wanted, but more would need a big rewrite on the code which is not worth it atm.
